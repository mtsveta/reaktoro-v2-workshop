    "# Chemical equilibrium: the basics\n",

    "Reaktoro performs chemical equilibrium calculations by *minimizing the Gibbs energy of the system* {cite}`Leal2017a`. In a Gibbs energy minimization problem, **temperature and pressure are prescribed** and **the chemical system is closed**. Thus, without mass transfer in or out of the system, the initial amounts of chemical elements and electric charge are conserved in the reactive process. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "There are many different classes of equilibrium problems where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **temperature and/or pressure may be unknown** (e.g., combustion in a rigid and adiabatic chamber where volume and internal energy are specified and temperature and pressure are calculated);\n",
    "* **the chemical system is open to certain substances** (e.g., aqueous solution in equilibrium with a mixture of gases with known partial pressures or fugacities, such as the atmosphere).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reaktoro's chemical equilibrium algorithm supports all these cases because it implements an algorithm to solve *parametric Gibbs energy minimization problems with general equilibrium constraints*. Thus, Reaktoro is not restricted to closed systems and prescribed temperature and pressure conditions, as we will see in the following sections and tutorials.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We give a simple example below in which we demonstrate the most basic form of performing chemical equilibrium calculations in Reaktoro. In this example, we want to model the combustion of 1 mol of CH{{_4}} and 0.5 mol of O{{_2}} at 1000 ÂºC and 100 bar. First, we define a chemical system consisting of only a gaseous phase:"
