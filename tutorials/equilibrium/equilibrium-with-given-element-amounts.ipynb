    "In the background of a `solver.solve(state)` function call, Reaktoro uses the *amounts of species* in the initial state to compute the *amounts of elements and charge* (further referred as *components*). These are needed in the underlying mass conservation equation solved along with the Gibbs energy minimization problem.\n",

    "In some applications, the amounts of components of the system are given and should be used as an input to the chemical equilibrium calculation. For instance, in reactive transport modelling, at each mesh cell/node (or degree of freedom generated by discretization), you would have a vector `b` representing the concentrations of elements and charges at that specific point in space. Below, we demonstrate how this can be achieved to replicate the calculations performed above."
