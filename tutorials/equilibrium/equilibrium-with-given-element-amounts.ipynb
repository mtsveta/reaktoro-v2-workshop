At each mesh cell/node (or degree of freedom), you would have a vector `b` representing the concentrations of elements and charges at that specific point in space. The equilibrium calculation would provide the amounts of species distributed among all phases (e.g., aqueous, liquid, gaseous, mineral, etc.). The associated chemical properties at equilibrium could be used to compute densities, enthalpies, and other properties of the phases.\n",
