In Reaktoro's YAML format, these chemical species are combined into one (e.g., `Mg(cd)`, `MgSO4(cd)`). This was done after observing improved performance and behavior in Reaktoro's chemical equilibrium algorithm, while still producing identical results. More specifically, this improved the determination of stable phases at equilibrium, which Reaktoro determines during the calculation (not at the end with individual stability tests for currently unstable phases).\n",
